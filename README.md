# Spark TDD Example

## Description

This fully functional example of how we like to do TDD development of Spark jobs that
read and write data from Cassandra. For a detailed description see the [companion
blog post](http://devs.womply.com/).

## Running the examples

1. First off, install sbt if you don't already have it:

   ```
   brew install sbt
   ```

2. Now you can run the tests:

   ```
   sbt test
   ```
